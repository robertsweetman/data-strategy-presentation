# UK Gov data maturity assessment

UK has it's OWN Data Maturity Assessment framework for Government...

## Levels
1. Beginning - minimum legal requirements, data isn't valued, no link to outcomes
2. Emerging - specialist access only, IT responsibility only
3. Learning - data literacy valued in leadership roles, non-expert staff require spcialist help, desire to improve, silos are being broken down
4. Developing - non-expert users require little specialist support, some external outreach and engagement, data seen as a priority
5. Mastering - org wide implementation, strong internal and external engagemen, future proofing, deep capability and understanding

4   - Engaging with others

3/4 - Having the right data, skills and knowledge -> mainly due to lack of SLT skills and issues with external users

3/4 - Having the right systems -> fails due to legacy systems, there is interest in modernisation however

4   - Knowing the data you have

4   - Making decisions with data

2/3 - Managing and using data ethically -> low score primarily due to an over-whelming lack of transparency

4   - Managing your data

5   - Protecting your data

4/5 - Setting your data direction

4/5 - Taking responsibility for data 

## Summary
Legacy systems reduce data maturity, which has a knock on effect on the ability to use data ethically and effectively.
