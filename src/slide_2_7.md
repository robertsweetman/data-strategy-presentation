## Data first research bulletin [(8)](./references_1.md#Data_First_Research_Bulletin_MoJ)
* Based off a data-linking programe running since 2019
* Brings together 8 justice datasets

## Examples of findings:

### Ethnicity and the Justice System 

_Compared to White defendants, Black defendants are significantly more
likely (41% more likely) to elect to have their case heard in the Crown Court, when controlling for age, sex, and number of previous convictions. Cases which elect to be heard in the Crown Court are more likely to result in immediate custody, and average sentence lengths are longer, also when controlling for these factors._

### Ethnic Inequalities in the Criminal Justice System

_Ethnic minority defendants from Black, Mixed, Chinese, and Other White groups were more likely to be remanded in custody by the police than White British defendants._

_Among defendants appearing in the Crown Court who entered a plea, ethnic minority defendants had higher rates of a Non-Guilty (NG) plea than white British defendants._

_Among those convicted in the Crown Court, defendants from the Black Caribbean, Chinese and Other White group were more likely to receive a custodial sentence_

_Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black Caribbean groups received significantly longer sentences than the White British group_
