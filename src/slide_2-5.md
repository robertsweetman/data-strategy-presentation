# Gap Analysis (from inside the client)

## Wins
* Databases are on the cloud
* Migration from Azure -> AWS has delivered an Infrastructure as code (IaC) solution
  * More robust disaster recovery
  * Better security posture
  * Increased reliability
  * Better monitoring
  * Promised lower costs following migration
    * An opportunity to turn things off  

## Fails
* Databases are still hosted on expensive VMs, not run as a service
* Database licensing costs are still high
* A lot of legacy apps had to move under un-supported OS and application version...
* Reporting using the legacy systems use SAP Business Objects, only recently upgraded

## Data Challenges
* Production data access requires security clearance
* Data analysis requires specialist knowledge, tools and training
* Data is not anonymised so cannot be made available to the public in any form
  * No outside scrutiny means that outcomes based on data become unchallenged/un-reliable potentially
* Data-driven to the extent that only _certain_ internal activities are driven by data

However: UK has it's OWN Data Maturity Assessment framework for Government...
