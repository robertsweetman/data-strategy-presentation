# Ethics, DEI and Sustainability Analysis

## Making Data Publically accessible
* Increases scrutiny
* Improve justice outcomes for ethnic minorities or under-represented groups
* Wider (non-academic) access leads to pressure, both internally and externally, to accept feedback and changes
* Increased scrutiny means a tendency towards justice outcomes that is more evenly applied
* At this point we don't even know what other insights might arise 
* Cost per prison place in the UK is Â£46K annually [(12)](./references_1.md#ReportCostofInequality)
* Miscarriages of justice cost money. [(13)](./references_1.md#ccrc-annual-report)
  * Claims rose by 20% in 2023
  * Increase in claims by women and minorities

## Technical implementation leapfrogs legacy issues
* Achieves an organisational and strategic goal WITHOUT a multi-year legacy overhall
  * Doesn't require the overhall of legacy systems
    * Cheaper for the tax payer
    * Renew/replace legacy apps without pressure

## Implementation on the EDGE of AI tech
* Given the speed of AI innovation:
  * Costs will continue to fall as the approach is implemented
* Use this project to attract AI talent into government
  * The 27% pension contribution for Civil Servants doesn't hurt either...
