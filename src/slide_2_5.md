# Gap Analysis

## From within the client

### Wins
* Databases are on the cloud
* Migration from Azure -> AWS has delivered an Infrastructure as code (IaC) solution
  * More robust disaster recovery
  * Better security posture
  * Increased reliability
  * Better monitoring
  * Promised lower costs following migration
    * An opportunity to turn things off  

### Fails
* Databases are still hosted on expensive VMs, not run as a managed service
* Database licensing costs are still high (Oracle)
* A lot of legacy apps had to move under un-supported OS and application version...
* Reporting using the legacy systems use SAP Business Objects, only recently upgraded

### Data Challenges
* Production data access requires security clearance
* Data analysis requires specialist knowledge, tools and training
* Data is not anonymised so cannot be made available to the public generally
  * You _can_ fill in a 50 page form to apply for access with no guarantee of success
  * No outside scrutiny means that outcomes based on data become unchallenged/un-reliable potentially

## Government's own State of Digital Government Review [(2)](./references_1.md#state-of-digital-government-review)

## Data is fragmented and underused.
_This holds back AI, machine learning, and advanced analytics. Only 27% of survey respondents believe their current data infrastructure enables a comprehensive view of operations or transactions. 70% say their data landscape is not well co-ordinated, interoperable, and does not provide a unified source of truth._

## Critical services depend on decades-old legacy technology. 
_The scale of legacy varies by organisation and is not consistently measured, but it is estimated to comprise 28% of systems in central government departments in 2024, an increase from 26% in 2023._
