# Risks and Mitigation

## Challenges
### Resistance to Cultural Change 
  
  * Senior management MUST buy in and communicate a clear vision of the change
    * How improving data transparency and access will benefit all users
    * How scrutiny should not be feared, but welcomed
    * How users and staff will ultimately benefit on a personal level
  
  * Users who currently "own" report generation will need to adapt
    * Become stewards & facilitators, not owners
    * Appreciate a greater exposure to what users require from the data
    * Be comfortable with the idea that insights might come from outside the org    
  
### Significant push-back around security risks

  * All levels of the organistion will be very concerned with the security implications
    * The technical implementation will be perceived as new and therefore untrusted
    * The idea of 'open data' is not accepted culturally, primarily due to security & GDPR
    * Possibility that the technology itself has been 'over-sold'

### Personnel and Skills

  * The MoJ, like basically every other org, has a skills gap around AI
    * Consultants are expensive and the expertise should be retained in house

## Risk Matrix

|  %    | Low Impact| Medium Impact | High Impact |
|----   |-----------|---------------|-------------|
| High  |           |               |  Cultural   |
| Med   |           |  Personnel    |  Security   |
| Low   |           |               |             |

## Mitigation

Cultural 
  - Senior leadership must fully embrace and evangelise the goal at all levels
  - Team leads must ALSO ensure individuals attend training
  - As part of the training:
    - Show examples where access to better/more open data would have led to better outcomes
    - As quickly as possible get to a place where there is a POC/demo to show staff
    - Encourage open debate as to risks/issues **once the internal pilot is live**

Security Risks
  - The primary goal of a POC will be to show the organisation that PII is not available
  - ALL users will have a significant period to 'dog-food' the application before the public
  - There will be a well constructed approach to security/penetration testing:
    - This will involve trying to exfiltrate PII
    - Commission a specialist 3rd party to undertake this work
    - Have internal security staff given specialist training on how to jail-break AI tools

Personnel
  - Encourage internal staff to expand their skills
  - Resist the urge to hire external consultants
    - Create an internal team of experts whose job it is to train others and share knowledge
    - Create training centered around the goal
