# Risks and Mitigation

## Cultural Change
* Resistance to change from staff and stakeholders
  * Must have clear buy in from senior management, and a clear vision of the change
    * How improving data transparency and access will benefit all users
    * How scrutiny should not be feared, but welcomed
    * How users and staff will ultimately benefit on a personal level
