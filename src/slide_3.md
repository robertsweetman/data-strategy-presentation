# Recommendation

## Increase Public Access

* From the Governments own Data Maturity Model there is a lack of transparency. 

* Ethical/discrimination/other issues going un-noticed.[(8)](./references_1.md#Data_First_Research_Bulletin_MoJ) 

* The data is only available for accedemic scrutiny under strict supervision. 
  * This effectively limits it's value to the organisation and the public since insights may only appear slowly and on an ad-hoc basis, if at all.

_It's hard to claim that the MoJ is a Data Driven organisation when the data is not available to be scrutinised widely._

## The pre-AI solution

Initiate a multi-year project to anonymise the data, eventually making it publicly available.

This would require significant technical changes:
  - Modernisation and standardisation of the databases, schemas and various tables inside them.
  - Likely re-write of key legacy applications
  - Large scale anonymisation effort on an ongoing basis
  - Significant security improvements to allow for public access
  - Increased cost, unless the data is made available in a more cost effective way

## The post-AI solution

Just literally on the scene are AI agents that leverage the Model Context Protocol (https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) which can connect to data, allow natural language questions to be the interface rather than a query language and return anonymized results.

At a high level combining the MCP with (for example) AWS Bedrock Guardrails (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-sensitive-filters.html) would allow for a secure, anonymised and queryable data set to be made available to the public.

This would also allow the data to be queried in a natural language format, a key to opening up engagement to non-academic users.

> Considering your evaluation, where could you recommend a change that would better exploit data and technology to deliver value?
> Further, could you recommend help to future-proof your organisation by exploring emergent technologies? Consider organizational strategy to ensure that your recommendation is developed sustainably in order to promote improvements in diversity and inclusion. (wk6)
