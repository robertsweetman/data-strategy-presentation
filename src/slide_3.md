# Recommendation for Change

From the maturity model the failure in transparency can clearly lead to ethical/discrimination issues going un-noticed.[()]

The data is available for accedemic scrutiny and only under strict supervision. 

This effectively limits it's value to the organisation and the public since true insights may only appear on an ad-hoc basis, if at all.

It's hard to claim that the MoJ is a data driven organisation when the data is not available to be scrutinised by the public.

## The pre-AI solution

Initiate a multi-year project to anonymise the data, eventually making it publicly available.

This would require significant technical changes:
  - Modernisation and standardisation of the databases, schemas and various tables inside them.
  - Likely re-write of key legacy applications
  - Large scale anonymisation effort on an ongoing basis
  - Significant security improvements to allow for public access
  - Increased cost, unless the data is made available in a more cost effective way

## The post-AI solution

Just literally on the scene are AI agents that leverage the Model Context Protocol (https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) which 

At a high level combining the MCP with (for example) AWS Bedrock Guardrails (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-sensitive-filters.html) would allow for a secure, anonymised and queryable data set to be made available to the public.

This would also allow the data to be queried in a natural language format, a key to opening up engagement to non-academic users.

>
> Considering your evaluation, where could you recommend a change that would better exploit data and technology to deliver value?
> Further, could you recommend help to future-proof your organisation by exploring emergent technologies? Consider organizational strategy to ensure that your recommendation is developed sustainably in order to promote improvements in diversity and inclusion. (wk6)
